# Trivia-Game
Trivia game made using Java's Swing and AWT packages to develop the GUI and application

Allows users to log in and create their username, entering a lobby room, where they can chat with everyone else in the lobby.
They can also create and join new rooms (can also search for existing ones) that act as gamerooms, starting when at least 2 players in the gameroom are "Ready".
The users can track their points (as well as others'), while also choosing to spectate the entire game or to skip rounds (the number of rounds is up to the user).
Before the game begins, the gameroom's leader can choose which of the available categories to use for that game.
Users of a gameroom can also add their own question and answer choices to any category of their choice.
